## 6. Bugs and Improvements

### Bug 2: Contact Link Not Working

Problem:
The Contact link did not open the correct page.
It added #contact to the current website URL.

Cause:
The navigation used an anchor link instead
of React Router navigation.

Solution:
Changed the Contact link in App.jsx from:

<a href="#contact">Contact</a>

To:

<Link to="/enquiries">Contact</Link>

Testing:
- Tested the Contact link locally.
- Rebuilt and redeployed the website.
- Tested the Contact link on GitHub Pages.

Result:
The Contact link now opens the
Safety Enquiries page correctly.

Status: Fixed and Passed

### Bug 1: Analytics Dashboard 404 Error

Problem:
The Analytics Dashboard displayed a 404 error
when the page was refreshed or opened directly.

Cause:
GitHub Pages did not automatically recognise
the React Router page URL.

Solution:
- Created a custom 404.html redirect file.
- Updated main.jsx to restore the requested route.
- Added a .nojekyll file.
- Rebuilt and redeployed the website.

Testing Result:
Passed

The Analytics Dashboard now opens correctly
after refreshing the browser.

Status:
Fixed and tested successfully.

Any problems found during testing will be documented
and corrected where possible.

## 7. Conclusion

Final testing is in progress.
